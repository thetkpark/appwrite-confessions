# Overview
I made this website with the inspiration from MIT Confessions. It's a Facebook page which MIT students can submit their confessions with the Google Forms. Then, the Facebook page admin will repost the confessions in the Facebook page timeline anonymously. The website I built has the same concept. People can submit their confessions and displayed to others. I used the AppWrite database to store all the confessions. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
